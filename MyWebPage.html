<p style= 'font-size:18px; color:white;' title='Introduction about the Seven Deadly Sins in Christianity'>
The seven deadly sins are a group of immoral behaviors in Christian teachings, considered to lead to further sin. 
</p>
<p  style= 'font-size:18px; color:white;'>
The anime based on these immoral behaviors, has each protagonist depicting one sin. The protagonists' powers and characteristics are related to their sin. 
</p>
<p  style= 'font-size:18px; color:white;'>
The main protagonist Meliodas has then gathered each of the sins to form a well-known alliance of fighters known as the 'Seven Deadly Sins'. According to the story's history, they were praised by the Liones kingdom early on for their bravery in fighting against monsters and protecting the kingdom. However, a small subset of the Holy Knights and Knights supposedly betrayed their homeland and turned their blades against their comrades in an attempt to overthrow the ruler of the kingdom. They blamed the 'Seven Deadly Sins' for the death of the Great Holy Knight Zaratras. This prompted the 'Seven Deadly Sins' to go into hiding. Later they reunite and defeats the Demon King. Finally the truth is revealed and the 'Seven Deadly Sins' regain their former pride.
